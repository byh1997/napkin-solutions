TODO FIX THIS IDIOTIC FORMATTING

\textbf{12A.} 

Let $R$ be a finite integral domain, and let $r\in R$ be nonzero.  

We claim that the map $R\rightarrow R$ given by $x\mapsto rx$ is a permutation of $R$.  Indeed, if $rx_1=rx_2$ for distinct $x_1,x_2\in R$, then $r(x_1-x_2)=0$, contradicting that $R$ is an integral domain.  

This means there exists $x$ such that $rx=1$, so $r$ is a unit.  Since this is true for all $r$, $R$ is a field.  \qed

a) If $J$ is maximal, we're obviously done.  Otherwise, $J$ is contained in a proper ideal $J_1$.  Then, if $J_1$ is maximal, we're done.  Else, $J_1$ is contained in a proper ideal $J_2$.  Continuing in this manner we get a chain $J\subsetneq J_1\subsetneq J_2\subsetneq\dots$.  Since $R$ is Noetherian, this chain has to stop - and it can only stop at a maximal ideal.  \qed

b) Consider the poset whose elements are proper ideals of $R$ containing $J$.  Every chain $J_0\subset J_1\subset \dots$ has an upper bound $\bigcup J_i$.  By Zorn's Lemma, there is a local maximum, which is a maximal ideal.  \qed

\textbf{12D.}

Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring.  Suppose for contradiction that some ideal $J\subset R[x]$ requires infinitely many generators.  We can then find an infinite sequence of non-redundant generators $\{p_i\}_i$ (i.e. $p_k$ is not in the ideal generated by $p_1,\dots,p_{k-1}$) of $J$.  

We initialize the ideal $I\subset R[x]$ as the zero ideal and add generators from $\{p_i\}_i$ one by one.  We will show that eventually we can't add any more non-redundant generators.  

For $n\in \Z_{\ge 0}$, define 
\[C_{I,n} = \{k\in \Z | I\text{ contains a polynomial of degree }n\text{ and leading coefficient }k.\}\]
Observe that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{I,n}$ is an ideal of $R$; 
\item $C_{I,n}\subset C_{I,n+1}$ for all $n$.  
\end{itemize}
The two remaining observations we need are: 
\begin{prop}
Adding a non-redundant generator to $I$ will grow at least one ideal $C_{I,n}$\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose we add $p_k$ to $I=\langle p_1,\dots,p_{k-1}\rangle$.  Since $p_k\not\in I$, we can mod out $p_k$ by $I$ until we reach a polynomial $p_k'$ such that no polynomial in $I$ matches $p_k$'s degree and leading coefficient.  Adding $p_k$ to $I$ is equivalent to adding $p_k'$; thus when we add $p_k$ to $I$ we grow the ideal $C_{I,\deg p_k'}$.  
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
The collection of ideals $\{C_{I,n}\}_n$ can only grow a finite number of times.  
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This follows from the fact that $R$ is Noetherian and the condition $C_{I,n}\subset C_{I,n+1}$.  
\end{proof}

So, after adding finitely many generators, we get stuck.  \qed
